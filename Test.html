        <p><em>Dear Reader,</em></p>
        <p>This context memo aims to provide an overview of my research proposal on the topic of cancer treatments and immunotherapies. This proposal aims to explore and compare different therapeutic approaches to cancers, specifically comparing three types of T-cell immunotherapies against conventional (radiation and chemotherapy) methods.</p>

        <h2>Cancer represents a formidable global health challenge...</h2>
        <p>Conventional methods for treating cancers, such as radiation and chemotherapy, have long been a crucial component of patient care. These approaches, however, suffer from off-target effects and potential patient resistance...</p>
        <!-- ... (rest of the content) ... -->
        <h2>In the past decade there has been increasing investment...</h2>
        <p>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are proteins engineered to express on the surface of T-cells, and enhance their tumor-targeting ability...</p>
        <!-- ... (rest of the content) ... -->
        <h2>In contrast to previously discussed immune-cell-based therapies...</h2>
        <p>While these immunotherapies provide valuable treatment regimens for cancers, they also face challenges in becoming widely accessible in the treatment of most cancers...</p>
        <p><em>Combining the strengths of different therapeutic approaches and developing personalized treatments tailored to individual patients' needs may be the key to maximizing therapeutic outcomes and improving long-term responses in cancer therapy...</em></p>
